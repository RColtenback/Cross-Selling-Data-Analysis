Another way to view the Dashboard in an way other than on Jupyter Notebook is by installing Voila:
'pip install Voila'
in command prompt to the folder where python is, or typing:
'!pip install Voila'
into a Jupyter Notebook file, and, in command prompt, running the code:
'voila *name of ipynb file*.ipynb'
or in Jupyter Notebook:
'!voila *name of ipynb file*.ipynb'.

So in this case, after installing Voila you can type, command prompt:
'voila dashboard.ipynb'
and the code will run and the dashboard will be exported to a local host.
